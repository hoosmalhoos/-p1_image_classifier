# Intro to Machine Learning - TensorFlow Project

Project code for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program. In this project, we will first develop code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow, then you will convert it into a command line application.

In order to complete this project , it's possible to run it on a local CPU but it likely would not work well.

### Data

The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large that it cannot be uploaded  into Github. there will be training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on.  Then there will be trained classifier to see if it can predict the type for new images of the flowers.
